# pygameLogo
Starter code for Assignment 1 of ICS3U

Part A: Logo
Use logo.py as a basis to create a logo for a company or app. Choose whichever company or app you like, but it should be well-known (4 marks)

Criteria/Requirements:

1. Your code must include a header (just make sure to fill in your name)

2. The size of the logo screen should be 400 x 400 pixels (this has already been set in the file). Use as much of this area as you can (make your logo large!)

The idea is that you should use the primitive functions (colours, lines, shapes, etc.) of pygame to draw your logo. Do *not* load an image file

You will be graded on the above criteria (use of space, use of pygame functions, no image file) and on how closely you capture the original logo or app (this is a bit subjective)

Your code should contain some comments describing what each part of the code does and how each shape relates to the whole (1 mark)

Part B: Action
Use the tutorials and the template file to create an animation. Choose whichever theme you like, but consider the criteria:
