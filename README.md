Instructions for Assignment 2 of ICS3U

Part A: Logo
Use logo.py as a basis to create a logo for a company or app. Choose whichever company or app you like, but it should be well-known (5 marks)

Criteria/Requirements:

1. Your code must include a header (just make sure to fill in your name)

2. The size of the logo screen should be 400 x 400 pixels (this has already been set in the file). Use as much of this area as you can (make your logo large!)

3. Use functions like screen.fill and the primitive shape functions (colours, lines, shapes, etc.) of pygame to draw your logo. Do *not* load an image file

4. You will be graded on the above criteria (use of space, use of pygame functions, no image file) and on how closely you capture the original logo or app (this is a bit subjective)

5. Your code should contain some comments describing what each part of the code does and how each shape relates to the whole 

Part B: Action
Use the tutorials and the action.py file to create an animation. Choose whichever theme you like, but consider the criteria. Themes might include a star field, snowflakes, etc. (5 marks)

1. Your code must include a header (similar to part A)

2. You must create a class for your sprites. You will need to add this to your repository

3. Draw your sprite using primitive shapes. You don't need to go crazy here, but use at least three shapes

4. Store your sprites in a list

5. Use a PNG for the background (this is in tutorial 5). Cite the source of your image in your code 

6. Play some background music (this is in tutorial 5). Cite the source of your music

7. Exit the animation when the space key is pressed
